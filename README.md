### **1. Project Description**

A brief overview of your project:
- What problem is it solving?
- What does your program do?
- Technologies used (e.g., C++, OpenMP for parallelization, JSON).

---

### **2. Features**

Highlight key functionalities:
- Recipe management (loading, adding, deleting, and displaying recipes).
- Parallel processing using OpenMP.
- Efficient file handling with JSON for storing recipes.
  
---

### **3. Problem Scope and Definition**

Clearly explain the problem the project solves:
- The scope of the project (recipe manager for efficient handling and organization of cooking recipes).
- The solution approach (object-oriented design, optimized for handling data in parallel).

---

### **4. Software Engineering Strategy**

Outline your software engineering approach:
- **Modularity:** Describe how the functionality is divided into modules (e.g., Recipe class, FileManager class, ParallelProcessing module).
- **Compilation Strategy:** Describe how the project is compiled and linked (mentioning g++ or other compilers).
- **Version Control:** Specify how GitHub was used for version control (branches, commits, pull requests).

---

### **5. Installation and Setup**

Step-by-step instructions to set up the project locally:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ayayasminebelloum/CompProgramming-2-Project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies, if any (mention if specific packages are needed).
4. Compile the project: `g++ -fopenmp main.cpp -o recipe_manager`.

---

### **6. Usage**

How to use the program:
- How to run the program: `./recipe_manager`
- Command-line options or interactive prompts.
- Example commands and outputs (e.g., how to add a recipe, view a recipe, etc.).

---

### **7. Code Structure**

Describe the overall structure of the code:
- Main modules or files (e.g., `recipe.h`, `recipe.cpp`, `main.cpp`).
- What each module does (e.g., `Recipe class` handles recipe data, `FileManager` handles reading/writing JSON).
  
Provide a sample of important code snippets for better understanding.

---

### **8. Memory Management**

Explain your approach to memory management:
- Dynamic memory usage (if applicable).
- How memory is allocated and freed efficiently.
- Use of smart pointers or manual memory management in C++.

---

### **9. Error Handling**

Detail how the project handles errors:
- How exceptions or errors are handled for various cases (e.g., invalid recipe data, file reading/writing issues).
- Any try-catch blocks or custom error messages.
  
---

### **10. Optimization Techniques**

Explain the optimization techniques used:
- How OpenMP is leveraged for parallel processing.
- Best practices followed in terms of code efficiency and memory usage.
- Any algorithmic improvements (e.g., sorting, searching optimizations).

---

### **11. Testing**

Describe your testing process:
- How did you ensure the code works as expected?
- Types of tests (unit tests, integration tests).
- Sample test cases used.

---

### **12. Version Control**

Explain how you used GitHub for tracking:
- Link to the GitHub repository.
- Branching strategy (if used).
- Commit frequency and documentation (how commits reflect changes).

---

### **13. Future Enhancements**

Mention any features or improvements that could be added:
- Adding a UI for better user interaction.
- Expanding recipe categories.
- Optimizing further for performance and scalability.

---

### **14. Contributors**

List the contributors to the project, including any collaborative efforts or individual roles:
- Yasmine Belloum – Lead Developer.

---

### **15. License**

State the project’s license (if applicable, e.g., MIT, GPL).

---

**Additional Notes**:  
- Tailor sections to your specific project details, especially regarding **Error Handling**, **Optimization**, and **Memory Management**.
- Include images, diagrams, or tables where necessary to enhance the understanding of the structure or flow of your program.
